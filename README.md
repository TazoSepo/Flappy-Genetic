# Flappy-Genetic
Genetic Algorithm Project (self-paced). Good old (Georgian) flappy bird learns how not to die at all with the help of Genetic Algorithms.


There are two code files game.js and Neuroevolution.js.

1. **games.js** is responsible for just game visualisation aspects like pipe sizes, bird parameters etc.
2. **Neuroevolution.js** is responsible for the Genetic Algorithm logic. Here are listed all of the methods of generation of epochs and logic behind how to choose the best representatives from each of the generations. Note: Code is written from the scratch and my pardon if it's not perfect.

P.S. Don't criticise the graphic of the game I tried my best :)

**Launching manual:** Just open the html file in the browser (magic, I know).
